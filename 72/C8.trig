        a                   :Note ;
        :noteText           "The another name of Gazhi house is Doring, which is perhaps the more common today; it is derived from the Lhasa mansion of the family, near the Trulnang and in front of the pillar (doring) which bears the text of the treaty of 822. The Gazhi estate lies to the north of Gyantse.\nA Gazhiwa without name or title occurs already in 1699; but the foundations for the greatness on the family were laid by Sonam Gyalpo of Khangchen in Shang, usually called Khangchennas. We know nothing of his beginings. At the end of 1715 or at the begining of 1716 Lajang Khan appointed him governor (garpon) of Mngaris Korsum (Western Tibet). It was due to his vigilance that late in 1717 the Qoshot ruler got the first news of the approach of the Zungar army. After the fall of Lhasa and Lajang's death he maintained his post in mngari; we do not know whether he recognised the authority of the new puppet regime. We hear next that he intercepted and annihiliated a party of Zungars who was carrying into exile to Zungaria some old Qoshot officials. By this action he started the Tibetan revolt against the Zungars. I have shown elsewhere that, although we cannot identify him with Desideri's \"Tar gum-tree-scij\", the Jesuit missionary built up his highly coloured tale around a historical kernet, represented by the deeds of Khangchennas. In 1721 garpon Khangchen nas received the title of Daiching Batur and the estate of Yar Drokling. After that year, his life identifies itself with the history of Tibet. He was murdered by his colleagues on 5th August 1727.\nIn 1725 Khangchen nas had asked the imperial government to appoint, as his deputy in the government of Mngari, his elder brother Gazhipa Tseten Tashi. The proposal was accepted, and on 25.V, 1725, we find already mention of Tod garpon Gazhiwa. After the muder of Khangchen nas, Pholha nas left for Mngari to assemble as army there. He appealed to Tseten Tashi, who had to avenge the death of his brother and willingly joined him; it was prabably his influence which obtained some auxiliary troops from the king of Ladakh as well. Gazhiwa joined the Tsang army at the head of 2000 men from Mngari, and took part in the first part of the compaign. He was killed with a score of his men at the end of 1727 in a skirmis near Gyakhar, an affair of little military significance but of unforeseen political import, because in its cource Thonpa Sicho Tseten went over to Phola nas, and Dokhar Tsering Wangyal was taken prisoner, both to become later the first appointment to Phola nas council of minister. The death of Gazhiwa gave to Phola nas control of Mngari, and that large region remained firmly in his hands to the end of his life.\nThis death seemed to mean an irreparable setback for the Gazhi family. But the Peking government had not forgotten its staunch fidelity in 1720. At the begining of 1729 the emperor bestowed upon the dead Gazhiwa the posthumous rank of a first-class taiji and granted to his elder son Namgyal Tseten the inheritance of this title. Ofcource, these Chinese honours implied no feudal tenure; and Mngari remained lost to the Gazhi house, since Phola nas appointed his own elder son Yeshe Tseten to its vacant governorship.\nMembers of the Gazhi family found a compensaion in brilliant careers within the new Tibetan government. In 1731 Namgyal Tseten sent to the emperor a letter of thanks and a gift of local produce. In return he was promoted to the rank of fu-kuo kung once enjoyed by his uncle Khangchen nas (who apparently had died childless) and was appointed to the office of Kalon. He married the younger daughter of Phola nas and died in 1739. \nFor some reason, about which all our sources are silent, his son Pasang Tsering was excluded from the succession; probably he was still a child when his father died. Anyhow, he obtained only the lesser rank of a third-class taiji, and not untill 1748 was he promoted to a first -class taiji. He was never entrusted with particularly important duties; as late as 1763 he was only gopa of Saga in Western Tibet. In that same year or in the following one, however, he was appointed U Dapon, as the successor of Phulung Zilnon Dorje; he appears as such in 1765 and 1771. His last mentions belong to 1778 and 1779 and after these dates we hear nothing more about him and his descendants, if any.\nThe headship of the Gazhi family had developed upon the younger brother of Namgyal Tseten, by name Gonpo Ngodup Rabten. He too was still young, and in 1737 he had entered the Nyingma monastery of Mindroling for a cource of studies. In 1739 he showed before the Dalai Lama his proficiency in grammatical, rhetorical and religious studies, whereupon he was granted the seal and title of Noyan Pandita; and by this name he was known henceforward. A few weeks later his elder brother died, and Pandita inherited the title of fu-ku kung and was also appointed, as a matter of cource and in spite of his youth, to the vacant seat of Kalon.\nAlthough Pandita's character does not appear as a particulary strong one, he was a very influential nobleman, because of his noble birth and his marriage with Deden Dolma, daughter of Phola nas. He was also very wealthy, and some chinese texts give valuable information about his income. He played a certain role in the hectic events of 1750. In that he was already at loggerheads with Gyurmed Namgyal, who suspected him of conspiring with the unfortunate duke of Mngari. When the Tibetan \"King\" was murdered and the two Manchu amban were lynched, he was in Lhasa and the Dalai Lama entrusted him with the task of re-establishing order. For a moment it seemed that he was going to be the successor of Gyurmed Namgyal. However, his appointment by the amban shortly before their violent death was completely unauthorised; and the emperor refused to confirm it. Neverthless he remained a prominent membe of the Kashag for more thana forty years, and it appears that the Chinese representatives dealth with him in preference to the other Kalon. Most of the information about his activity belongs to the later part of his life. In 1777/8 he was one of the most splendid hosts during the Panchen's stay in Lhasa and he showed the same courteous officials directed some repair work in the Trulnang. When in that same year the people of San-shan or San-an committed some robberies and intercepted consignments of tea intended for the Dalai Lama, and the Chinese government sent troops to punish them, Pandita was ordered to betake himself to Markham at the head of 300 Tibetan soldiers, accompanied by some trusted officers; he left Lhasa on the 10th December, 1779. He co-operated wholeheartedly with the imperial commanders in that little, forgotten war, and swas still encamped in Sanang in the middle of 1780. Soon after he returned to Lhasa, and in the following year he and his son went to the Tengri nor, to meet the remains of the Panchen which were travelling in state back to Tibet. By this time age and the weariness of the long Sanang campeign had told upon him; and when in 1782 he broke two ribs in a fall from his horse, he asked to be allowed to retire. The amban supported his request, which the emperor granted, together with some precious gifts. At the beginning of 17183 he even took the vows of a Genyen. Still, the ambans continued to consult him occasionally on affairs of state, and as late as January 1791 he took part in a meeting of the Kashag on the occasion of Samati Pakshi arrival. He died in 1792. \nHis son Sonam Tenzin Paljor Tsering, uasually called by the shorter name of Tenzin Paljor, was taught in 1775 by Yeshe Gyaltsen (1713-1793), the yongzin of the 8th Dalai Lama; at the same time or slightly later he was also a pupil of Longdol Lama. A concreat relic of this connection with two of the foremost scholars of his time is found in a short instruction on the Lamrim chenmo dedicated to him by Yeshe Gyaltsen, and in a commentary on two grammatical works composed by the young nobleman himself. He is otherwise not often mentioned in those years. After his father's retirement the amban Po-ch'ing-e, acting upon the recommendatin of the Dalai Lama, proposed Tenzin Paljor's appointment as Kalon and his succession to the rank of fu-kua kung. At first the emperor demurred; he passed some scathing remarks on the youthful inexperience of the Dalai Lama, who blindly supported Pandita, and on the rather stupid behaviour of Po-ch'ing-e; he refused an immediate appointement and asked for further confidential information. It appears, however, that he was immediately satisfied on this score, because in the 3rd month of 1783 the appointment of Pandita's son as Kalon was offcially announced in Lhasa. But the title of fu-kua kung was withheld for the moment.\nTenzin Paljor acted as the Neshan of the amban in his visits to Tsang in 1783 and 1786. About this time he enhanced his position by marrying the younger sister of the Dalai Lama. In 1786 he accompanied the departing Samati Pakshi as far as the Drichu region. Late in 1788 he accompanied the imperial general Ch'eng-te, commanding an advance unit of the Chinese army, who was supposed to drive the Gorkhali invaders out of Tibetan territory. But neither party was cager for a flight, and the Panchen's father Palden Dondup and the Sakya Solpon Lama Sonam Yeshe exerted themselves to mediate the conflict. In the spring of 1789 he joined them as representative of the Lhasa government, while the impeial commissioner Bajung too went to the border. They discussed the matter with a Gorkhali delegation and the result was a preliminary agreement, signed at Kirong on 12 Shravana badi 1846 ( 17th August, by which the Tibetan delegation promised to pay an annual tribute of 50001 rupees. Immediately after Tenzin Paljor returned to Lhasa, where he creceived at last the coveted title and seal of fu-kwo kung. The final treaty was signed on 2 Vaishakha shudi 1847 V.S. (16th April 1790), Bajung represented to the emperor this rather shamful surrender as a great success, for which he was rewarded. But later the truth leaked out and Bajung commited suicide (1791), while Tenzin Paljor was the target of deep suspicion.\nIn the 3rd month of 1791 he was sent to Nyalam, the headquarters of the Nyalam district on the Nepalese border, to hand over the balance of the tribute still due and to negotiate with the Gorkhali commanders; he arrived there on 24th July. The events that followed are not clear, as the Tibetan, Chinese and Nepalese accounts differ. So much is sue, on 8 or 9. VII (7th or 8th August) the Gorkhalis attacked the Tibetan delegation at Kuti by surprise, overpowered the escort and siezed Tenzin Paljor and Kalon Yothok, who were carried in chains to Kathmandu. According to the Nepalese version, the Gorkhali officers Damodar Pande and Bam Shah suspected the Tibetans of engineering a plot to kill the Zhamarpa, the Tibetan high incarnate and refugee who was inciting the Nepalese against his home country. According to the Tibetans and the Chinese, this was due to wanton and deliberate treachery of the Nepalese. The coup led to a renewed outbreak of hostilities.\nTenzin Paljor's captivity termed into a real disasterfor him, as the Manchu authorities suspected him of collusion with the Gorkhalis, the more so as his wife was a niece of the Zhamar. Accordingly, he was disimissed from his office of Kalon. \nIn 1792 general Fukangga invaded Nepal, penetrating deep into th country. The Kathmandu government put forward feelers for a truce, but the Manchu generals laid down, as a preliminary condition for any sort of negotiation, that Tenzin Paljor should be delivered into their hands. The Gorkhalis complied, and on the 28th July 1792 Tenzin Paljor and Kalon Yuthok were delivered at the imperial camp. He was escorted to Tibet and Fukangga ordered him to be placed under close guard and not allowed to communicate with his family; he was to be sent to Peking later. Actually he did not leave Tibet and was merely subjected to a judicial interrogation (September-October). In the meantime things cooled down, and the emperor ordered that judgement on him should be deferred to more peaceful times. The final decision came on 15th July, 1793, when he was deprived of the rank of fu-kwa kung and was placed on probation; he was given to understand that, if he repented of his misdeeds and behaved well for two or three years, he would be appointed a Depa (i.e a Zongpon). After two years of quiet private life, the term expired and in 1795 he was given office (kuan li), we do not know in which capacity. In 1798 he and his son entertained the 8th Drukchen incarnate as their guest. After the scandalous events of 1805, which will be told below and by which he succeeded after all in shouldering his son into the Kashag, he continued his life in Lhasa, appearing as former minister on the New Year's festival of 1808 and later in the same year. At the end of 1808 he (Doring yab) was received in audience in the Potala after having completed a period of spiritual retreat at Ragka Drak. Lastly, the Kalon Gazhiwa yab se mentioned in 1809 may still refer to him and his son. No later information is forthcomming. During these last years he turned his mind again to religious studies, and at least three of the minor works in the Sungbum of the Rating Trulku Losang Yeshe Tenpa Rabgye were sponsored by him: a commentary on a minor work of Tsongkhapa, a pranidhana and a tract  on the purification ceremony called kangso.\nTenzin Paljor's son Migyur Sonam Paljor was born in 1784. When his father was deprived of the title of kung, the son was granted, as an act of grace and in consideration of the earlier merits of the Gazhi family, the lesser rank of first-class taiji. During the next years he led the usual life of a young aristocrat under the guidance of his father. He too was a pupil of Longdol Lama and in 1798 and 1813 had the 8th Drukchen as his guest. In 1805, when he was 21, father and son acting together secured the entrance of the latter into the Kashag by heavily bribing the amban Ts'e pe-ke. This unsavoury intrigue caused something of a scandal, and anonymous pesters were attached to the walls of Lhasa, denouncing the fraud; as a consquence, the emperor sent two special commissioners to hold a strict investigation, and Ts'e-pa-k'e, having been found guilty, was dismissed and punished. It seems that Migyur Sonam Paljor's appointment was cancelled; but even if this is correct, soon after he was finally and lawfully given a seat in the Kashag, because we find him often mentioned as Kalon in and after 1808. He continued in office for nearly 30 years, but his record is certainly not impressive. In 1809-1810 he made a tour of inspection in the Nagchu region. He took a prominent part in the ceremonies of Dalai Lama's enthronment in 1822. In the following year he accompanied the amban to Tsang, and a few months later he was sent to the Nagchu. In 1824 he was entrusted with the task of installing the new incarnate of Rating. In 1825 he was sent on mission to Powo, from where he went to Kham and then back to Lhasa. Similaryly in 1825 he left for Kongpo on a mission to Powo; he came back in the next year. As late as the 3rd month of 1834 he accompanied a Chinese general on inspection; but he died in that same year 1834. \nThe boy born in the Doring family, who in 1789 was recognised as the new incarnation of the Lo Sempa chenpo with the name Losang Shenyen Dakpa Gyaltsen, was a younger brother of Migyur Sonam Paljor.\nIn 1813 Kadrung Gazhi se was sent with a Tsedrung to Tashi Lhunpo to invite the Panchen to Lhasa, in orde to impart the vows of getsul to the Dalai Lama. This may be the same as Gazhi se Dondup Tseten, who in 1821 and 1822 was a Tsipon in charge of the arrangements for the journey of the newly found Dalai Lama to Lhasa; in 1818 he was lachag. He too might have been a brother of Migyur Sonam Paljor, but we cannot be sure; in any case, he could not be a son because of obvious reasons of age.\nGazhi Nyima Lhundup was possibly a son of Migyur Sonam Paljor or of Dondup Tsewang. He appears as Sherpang in 1843, when the Chinese government granted him the peacock feather; he may be the Doring Gzahiwa mentioned without a title in 1845. On the other hand we are informed that a Gazhi se was appointed Sherpang in 1847; so either there is a patent contradiction between Chinese and Tibetan texts, or this Gazhiwa of 1847 is a different person. In 1849 Doring Sherpang acted as Neshan to the prince-abbot of Sakya returning from Lhasa to his seat. In 1852 Gazhiwa was in attendance to the ministers. In 1854 Doring appears as Tsipon, accompanying the coffin of the dead amban Wen-wei on the first stages of the long journey to Peking. In 1856 he acted as Lhasa Neshan during the ceremonies of the selection by lot of the 5th Panchen. In the following years Doring taiji or Doring tsipon was Neshan to the amban Man-ch'ing on his visit to Tashi Lhunpo. On 25.I.1858, Tsipon Gazhiwa Nyima Lhundup received the rescript by which he was appointed Kalon. In this capacity he collaborated late in 1859 with the special commissioner Li Yu-pa in putting down a serious disturbance in the Chamdo region, caused by one Gonpo Wangchuk, in which the semi-independent Tibetan chief of Powo had intervened. By a rather unsavoury trick the ringleaders were arrested and five o their followers were executed; after this, the parties agreed to pursue their quarrel by legal means before a judge. The report on this affair was received at Peking on 17th April, 1860. Nyima Lhundup received little thanks for his activity, because the reward went to Kalon Cangyab pa, who acted as judge, and to his helpers. it is also curious to note that, when the latter and his suite obtained an audience from the Dalai Lama upon their return to Lhasa, taiji Gazhiwa is not given the title of Kalon. Also, when in the 3rd month of 1860 he accompanied the amban Manch'ing to Tsang, he is simply called Doring taiji. So either he had been dismissed, or his post of Kalon had been a purely temporary one. Nothing further is heard about him.\nA Doring taiji accompanied the amban to Tsang in 1869 and was receive by the Panchen in 1876. He was also in charge of a part of the arrangements for the enthronment of the Dalai Lama in 1879; in the same year he is called Depon Gazhiwa.\nA Gazhi se was Kadron in 1892, when he was sent to Pagri; he was a Sherpang in 1896, acting as Neshan for the amban K'aci-huan returning to China, and in 1897. But after 1899 the head of the family was debarred from holding office, because a lady of his family was the wife of Norbu Tsering, the brother of the former regent Demo Trulku, who was supposed to have engineered the witchcraft attempt against the Dalai Lama in that year. He was alive in 1934,  being 73 years old at that time, and died in 1937. \nHis only son Doring Tenzin Norbu (b. 1900), was given military training at Gyantse (1915), on which occassion he was also granted the title of taiji, He entered government service in 1917 and was appointed Tsang Dapon in 1919. In 1921 he was in charge of the Monlam festival. Two years later he was sent to Shillong for gunnery training. In 1924 he raised the eleventh regiment in Tsang, but in the following year, upon the general stand-down of the army, he left the military career. His title of taiji was taken away in 1930 and he was degraded to the sixth rank because he was suspected of intriguing against the government. In 1932 he was appointed Nyalam Zongpon and in 1934 he was promoted to the 4th rank and was entrusted with a delicate mission to the Panchen, then living in exile on the Chinese border. He returned in 1938 and was appointed supervisor of the property of the late Dalai Lama. His title of taiji was restored soon after. Afterwards he led a retired life and in 1956 became completly blind. He died after 1959 at Gyantse.\nThe name of this family, one of the most noble in Tibet, was kept alive by the marriage of Dadul Wangyal (b.c. 1913), of the Montshowa family, to Tenzin Norbu's only sister.
