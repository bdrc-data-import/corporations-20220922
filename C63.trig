        :noteText           "The Gar ('gar) clan, along with the Nyen (snyan), originate from the ministers of Ngewo Trana (ngas bo khra sna), one of the 12 kingdoms of pre-imperial Tibet. During the imperial Pugyel period, Gar Tongtsen Yulsung was a very important minister to the 33rd King Songtsen Gampo. During his time, the office became hereditary. The Gar clan became very powerful and started to threaten the power of the Yarlung dynasty. In 698, the empress Trimalo and her son Tridusong defeated Gar Tongtsen's son, who escaped to China with his followers, and the reign of the councilors of the Gar clan came to an end. The Gar clan continued and became quite widespread, it seems, with many claiming to be the descendant of Minister Gar. Centuries later, the Gar family would gain prominence as lords of the Derge kingdom around the seventeenth century. As in other noble families, rule over the monasteries would pass to the eldest son while a younger brother would marry and continue the familial line. It seems the Gar is one of the 18 divisions of the ancestral Go clan."@en .
