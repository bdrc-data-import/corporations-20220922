        :noteText           "Full name of the family is Phuntsok khangsar. The Phunkhang estate is situated in the neighbourhood of Kaduk at the mouth of Yarlung valley. This is the family of the 11th Dalai Lama.\n\tIts founder was Kontse Tsewang Dondup (b.1809). On 10th October, 1841, he received the title of fu-kwa kung, the coral button and the peacock feather were added in 1848. In 1845 the government had granted him a family estate (Yabzhi). He took a lively part in official life, at least in its ceremonial aspects; but we never read of him wielding any political influence. Apparently he survived his son and was alive as late as 1860.\nHe had three sons. the eldest is mentioned in 1847, when he performed the Tsari pilgrimage with his parents, and in 1852; possibly also in 1860 along with his father.\nThe second was the 11th Dalai Lama.\nThe younger son, Ngawang Gyaltsen, first mentioned in 1845, was recognised in 1848 as the new incarnate of Dip tsechok ling, one of the four \"royal monasteries\" of Lhasa. As such he is mentioned in 1852, 1853 and 1855. Elsewhere he is called simply the gyal kuzhab, Lord younger brother; thus in 1852 and along with his father in 1860.\nNo personal names are found in the following years, except for a gyud dad (follower) phunkhang se, who in 1888 was in charge of 1000 men of Dagyab marching to the Sikkim border. Only the yabzhi Phunkhangpa occurs on formal occassion in 1860, 1862,1871, 1874, 1879, 1888, 1898, 1901, 1902. The Chinese texts register no further grant of the kung title; and yet the title was renewed at an unknown date, becuase the Phunkhang is mentioned in 1877, 1878 and 1882. Also the \"duke yabzhi, whom the British found in 1904 as zongpon of Gyangtse, must have been a Phunkhang.\nAccording to the rules, the head of the family in the following generation bore the lesser title of taiji. This was Phunkhang Tashi Dorje (b. 1888). He entered civil services as early as 1902 and in 1909 he went from Lhasa to shorgo to greet the Dalai Lama upon his return to Tibet. In 1910 he was in charge of the monlam festival, when the Chinese troops, arriving in Lhasa on the 3rd day of the year (12th February), met Phunkhang on the road and fired upon him; his servant and his horse were killed and he himself was beaten and placed under arrest in the Chinese camp. Not surprsingly, he supported the national rising; contribution of moneyand men came forth from yabzhi Phunkhang in 1912 and 1913. In 1914 he was a rimzhi. In 1919 Phunkhang taiji Tashi Dorje was appointed Kung, the only attempt by the Dalai Lama to succed the difianet Chinese Ching dynasty as fons honoram. In 1924 he was collector of the corn-tax (du kal dodampa) in Tsang. In 1926 he became the lay head of the Foreign Office, with the additional title of jasak, and kept this charge till 1938. In that year he was appointed Kalon, although his sight was utterly bad and was getting worse. He was dismissed from the Kalon toward the end of 1946 and a few months later was implicated in the conspiracy of former regent Takdak. He was imprisoned for about a month and eventually went off with a fine, the title of Kung being given back to him. He retired to private life and died in Lhasa.\nHis eldest son Gonpo Tseten (b.1918) was Kadrung in 1938, Gyantse zongpon in 1939, and married the eldest duaghter of the Maharaja of Sikkim in 1940. When his father was arrested, the son was also held for a short time. He spent his rest of life in Kalimpong.\nThe second son Jampal Nyamnyid B.c. 1920) was a favourite of the Rateng regent. He became a Kadron in 1939 and Nyerzod in 1943; he died quite young, perhaps c. 1945. ( Petech L., Aristocracy and Government in tibet, p. 25-28, Roma 1973)"@en .
